# Value Prediction End to End ML Pipeline

The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that will enable the prediction of values, such as prices of services and items, consumption values, and more.

# Aproach

The goal is to implement most parts directly in order to understand the core and important aspects of the entire MLOps process. This approach aims to improve technical skills and deepen the understanding of core concepts in ML/AI systems and development workflows.

# Implementation

The following are the steps involved in implementing the project

## 1. Data ingesting

This step involves creating an abstract method to load data from a given file, such as a .zip file containing CSV files.

* data processing using Julius .....visualisation and etc

## 2. Stratergy plan
deciding tools and algorithms to use
### Analysis
We are going to analyse and study data various properties
-creating methods that will print us analysis an reports
